# about me
I enjoy technology and I'm currently on a journey to understand how it works, learning programming, git/github, web-dev and bash, after learning this, I'll see what I will learn next.
I'm curious, I enjoy understanding how something works, I like to create things that people will use and this is probably why I'm attracted to programming.
I'm shy, introvert, but if the right person is with me, I talk a lot. 
I can be stubborn when trying to understand something, which means I may ask a lot of "why" and "how" and some people gey annoyed by that.
I hope to one day be part of a team in a big company that delivers helpful services to millions of people or create my own company or service.
